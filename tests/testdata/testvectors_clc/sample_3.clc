> In a nutshell, if you want special behavior, declare a node type
foo: 'bar'
embed: 'code/deadfish'
baz: 'zoop'
    iiisdsiiiiiiiioiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiioiiiiiiiooiiio
    dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddoddddddddddddo
    dddddddddddddddddddddsddoddddddddoiiioddddddoddddddddo
    dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddo

That being said, "partially" understanding a type might be perfectly reasonable.
For example, most text display these days has an understanding of "code", so
it would be able to interpret the above as code, even if it didn't have a
syntax file for deadfish.

> Billable hours
foo: 12.34
embed: 'data/json'
baz: null
    {
        "monday": 8,
        "tuesday": 8,
        "wednesday": 8
    }

> Code blocks are nodes, too
embed: 'code/python'
    if True:
        print('hello, world?')

    if False:
        print('I guess nobody answered')
