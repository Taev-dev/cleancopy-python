> A note on comments
id: 'the_first_section'
summary: 'Comments. Do you speak them?'
    <<<Note that comments are supported. An optional top-of-file comment as
    above can be used if you want a way to detect syntax simply.>>>

    Also note that escape sequences take precedence over comments. So if you
    want to have a literal ``(((>>>)))`` sequence, you can just put it in
    triple parentheses like this: ``[[[(((>>>)))]]]``


Any node with a type declaration is treated as not-clean-copy. Applications
that understand that type should process it accordingly, but any applications
that don't understand the type should treat it as block raw text, similar to
a generic code block.
