> Inline formatting is legit

    You can, of course, also have inline formatting -- just like markdown. So,
    **bolding** things is fine. Or //italics//. Or ~~strikethroughs~~. Or
    ``monospace``. Or even __underlines__!

    Also, check this out: formatting //can be **nested** and even works across
    line breaks!//

    A note on things like getting creative with "blanks": though this might
    actually be better served by inline metadata, you can actually implement
    this with underscores, it's just awkward, because you have to use escape
    sequences, like this: "when I (((_____))), help me (((_____))), so I can
    (((_____)))."
